Step 1:

	We want to turn this C statement:
		exit(21);

	Into this:
		global _start
		_start:
			mov rax, 60					; Exit = syscall 60
			mov rdi, 21					; Move error code 21 into rdi
			syscall

	Lexical analysis turns the text into tokens:
		RETURN
		INT_LIT => 21
		SEMI-COLON

Step 2:

	Refactored the code to create Tokenizer and Parser classes, and created
	the grammar declaration for our language in grammar.md

Step 3:

	First, change the way "exit" is called:
		exit(21);

	Next, allow for variables:
		var x = 7;
		var y = 8;
		exit(x);
